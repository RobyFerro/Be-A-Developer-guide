# Design Patterns

Design patterns are time-tested, optimal solutions to common software design problems. They represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers and can significantly speed up the development process by providing developers with a way to solve common design issues.

Design patterns can be classified into three categories:

- **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects, ensuring that the components work together as a whole.

- **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

Remember, design patterns are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code; they are descriptions or templates for how to solve a problem in a way that can be reused in many different situations.
