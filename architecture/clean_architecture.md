# Clean Architecture

In this section, we will focus on Clean Architecture, a set of practices and principles advocated by Robert C. Martin, which encourages the separation of concerns between the software in an application.

The main idea is to make the software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Clean Architecture is about placing the business rules and application model at the center of the program and keeping details, such as databases and frameworks, at the outskirts.

By following Clean Architecture principles, developers can produce systems that are:

- Independent of Frameworks
- Testable
- Independent of the UI
- Independent of the Database
- Independent of any external agency
